## Welcome to my Web Development blog.

First of all let me give an introduction. The name is Kevin A. Lloyd, from a small island in the Caribbean called the **Commonwealth of Dominica**. Since the age of 12, I realized that in some way, shape or form Computers we going to be a key aspect in my future; both personally and professionally. I started programing in Turbo Pascal 7.0 ages ago. From then I&#8217;ve moved on to Visual Basic, C++, and C#. I&#8217;ve also done some scripting such as JavaScript, PHP, etc.

I have come to consider myself a web developer. This blog is the result of the past six (6) months, when I really got into web development.

Here we cover some main topics, which I have gained experience with lately.

  * There is, of course, Joomla that spawns from the late Mambo CMS. I&#8217;ve used this on some sites that I have deployed for some of my clients.
  * There is phpBB, which is a forum software that I&#8217;ve used a lot on some sites I&#8217;ve been working with.
  * SMF is another forum software I use from time to time
  * At work, I&#8217;ve gotten into contact with Fact CGI, which is a C based form of internet programming that allows for a CGI program to run continually on the server side.
  * Working with Fast CGI has slowly brought me into the world of Ajax and helped me gain a greater understanding of Web 2.0

These are the experiences that I&#8217;m going to share with you.
