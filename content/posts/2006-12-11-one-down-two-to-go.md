OK, So I&#8217;ve just gotten done with my Algebraic Structures (Part 1) final exam. Yes, Part 1. It was supposedly designed to _help_ us in that the in-class portion does not contain any proofs. The result is instead of having one normal sized test taking up just 2 hours, we have one in-class portion that was really difficult and took one and a half hours; and one take-home portion that is full of proofs that is going to take about eight hours. Yaaaaayyy. That&#8217;s what I always wanted.

Tomorrow I have Contemporary Programming Languages and I need to hand up my Numerical Analysis take home exam. That should be simple enough. On Wednesday I have to hand up Part 2 of Algebraic Structures and then that&#8217;s it. Did you hear me? That&#8217;s it. Well, that is after I graduate on Saturday. And I&#8217;ll be done with school for a while; a very long while. After this I have about one month before work starts. Yes, that&#8217;s a whole other story on it&#8217;s own, I got a JOB. I got to move and all that stuff. But hey, I&#8217;m just so psyched about finishing with school that I can barely contain myself. Again, this is a 10 minute break from my studies and I got to get back to it. I don&#8217;t want my GPA to take any other unnecessary dips before I&#8217;m all done. Rumor has it I&#8217;ll be graduating with honors. Let&#8217;s keep our fingers crossed.
