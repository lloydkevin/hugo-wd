Most of you prefer a framework that is **Quick and Easy**. Hey, I&#8217;m totally with you guys on that. When deciding on a web development framework, it has to be easy. It&#8217;s no fun if it takes hours to learn and saves you minutes. For me, CakePHP definitely fits this bill. The bake routines save me _so_ much time during initial development.

Next on the list was a **Less Code Needed** and a **Small Learning Curve**. Again, that would definitely fit high on my list. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m just lazy that way.

That last result on the list is interesting, but expected. Not many people needed the framework to have a **Small Footprint**. With the type of processing that is required nowadays, sometimes the _lite/light_ version doesn&#8217;t cut it. With that said, we also have a lot more processing power to push those _heavy_ frameworks along. In my opinion, it&#8217;s less important that a back end framework be light as apposed to a JavaScript framework. The back end is handled strictly by the server, so the user doesn&#8217;t take the hit. With a JavaScript framework the user needs to download the entire thing. In this day and age it has become more cost effective to through some more CPU at the problem while saving weeks (or even months) in development time.
