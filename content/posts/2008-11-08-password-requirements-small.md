I&#8217;m not sure how many of you guys share my views about passwords. Or maybe I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable with other people telling me what to do. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s it. If I decide that my password is going to be _qwerty, password, letmein,_ or even _123_; I think that&#8217;s my business. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I totally understand the reason behind this. Some sites are trying to protect the users against themselves.

### Reasonable Requirements

Now some of these requirements I can understand. Some of them are actually reasonable. I can deal with a minimum length; although these days they seem to be getting longer than eight (8) characters.

I just don&#8217;t think that I need this type of protection. Although I don&#8217;t use the same password for every website (any more, lol). Currently, I use an algorithm to generate a password for a new site. It&#8217;s a combination of a common _stem_ or _base_ and appending the service name that I&#8217;m logging into (eg. Yahoo, Gmail, etc.)

### My Problem With Requirements

Currently, my stem only consists of lowercase letters and numbers. I know it&#8217;s not the most secure base, but it&#8217;s long enough and it serves the purpose. What I can&#8217;t stand is a site that needs me to enter a special character or an upper case character.

Call me crazy, I just hate having to hit the stupid <Shift> key when I need to be typing in a password. Hell, I hate holding down the shift key, period. So for all you website administrators out there, please don&#8217;t force me to do anything I don&#8217;t want to. The only thing this results in, is me forgetting my password the next time I come to your site.
