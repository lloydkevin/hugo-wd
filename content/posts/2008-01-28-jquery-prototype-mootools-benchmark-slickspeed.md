### Introduction

Before I even start, let me state that I&#8217;m a JQuery fan. Ever since I&#8217;ve started with JavaScript frameworks I&#8217;ve weighed the pros and cons, and trust me there are a lot. You&#8217;ll always find people arguing Prototype, JQuery or MooTools. I went with JQuery because it could do all that I wanted with the least amount of bloat. I&#8217;m sorry, Prototype may do a hell of a lot, but I don&#8217;t think that I could make enough use or that 100 KB to justify it. Plus, Prototype can&#8217;t even handle basics on its own without having to piggy back off of script.aculo.us and it&#8217;s effects library.

### Speed

Now with every new version of a Framework that comes out, this argument comes up again and again. Finally, we have something to put the arguments to rest.

In my personal testing, I&#8217;ve found that JQuery 1.21 leads the pack, but only in Internet Explorer. In Firefox it comes in dead last. Does this discourage me? Maybe a lil&#8217; bit. Am I going to stop using JQuery and switch to Prototype? I think not.

### What Do You Need?

It all depends on your uses for said framework. From the looks of it, Mootools looks more like a full fledged programming language. With all the definitions of new objects, etc. If, for some reason I&#8217;m needing to build an application in JavaScript then I&#8217;ll revisit it. But until now, the most JavaScript that I&#8217;ll be doing is so simple effects on elements (shows, hides, slides, class changes, etc) and a couple Ajax requests.

For this I don&#8217;t think I should suffer the 120 KB that Prototype has to offer, even though it&#8217;s blazing fast in Firefox. With that said, even if I hate Internet Explorer, it is still, by far, the most popular browser out there. So I take comfort in the fact that the majority of my audience is getting the speed benefits of JQuery.
