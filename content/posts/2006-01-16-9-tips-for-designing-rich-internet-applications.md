Bill Scoot over at [Looks Good Works Well][1] wrote a very interesting article: [Nine Tips for Designing Rich Internet Applications][2].

Here&#8217;s a synopsis:

  1. Make it directly interactive
  2. Make it inviting
  3. Use lightweight, in-context popups instead of page transitions where possible
  4. Use real-estate creatively
  5. Cross page boundaries reluctantly
  6. Create a light footprint
  7. Think of your interactions as storyboards
  8. Communicate transitions
  9. Think in objects

Most of this we&#8217;ve heard before, but I like lists ðŸ™‚
