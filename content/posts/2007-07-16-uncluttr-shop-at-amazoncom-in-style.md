OK, now this is really cool. If you ask me it&#8217;s a beautiful use of AJAX.

  1. Pick a category
  2. Search
  3. Click on an item and get a pop up with details
  4. Click and Drag items to the shopping cart on the right

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/uncluttr.png?ssl=1" rel="lightbox"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/.thumbs/.uncluttr.png?resize=400%2C156&#038;ssl=1" alt="uncluttr.png" title="uncluttr.png" border="0" height="156" width="400" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

Yep, that&#8217;s it. The name fits great. There is absolutely none of the clutter that you get from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon&#8217;s</a> main website.

This site deserves a lot more than what it&#8217;s getting right now.
