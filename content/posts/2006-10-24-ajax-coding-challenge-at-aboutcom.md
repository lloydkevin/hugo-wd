[About.com][1] is having a coding competition. Ajax is the topic. So all you Ajax guys out there, this is where you flex your muscles. Give it your best shot, rules at the bottom.

One thing I find funny is that they actually allow the use of third party scripts and libraries. This makes this challenge quite interesting in the sense that developers don&#8217;t need to code much from scratch. This allows their real coding skill and creativity to go towards making the application better on a whole.

Good luck guys.

> The Rules* The script must use Javascript to perform an Ajax style call to the server to retrieve data to update the current web page.
  
> * The total of all Javascript and other client side files added to the page to perform the Ajax tasks must not exceed 10k in total size.
  
> * The server side processing can be done using whatever programming language you prefer.
  
> * You need to include a link to a page that contains a working version of the script.
  
> * You agree to a viewable copy of both the Javascript and server side script being placed on this site.
  
> * Any use of third party script libraries must comply with the licensing agreements applicable to those libraries.
