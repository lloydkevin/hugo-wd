I found this post interesting. Although I don&#8217;t consider myself much of a blogger, bills do have to be paid.

As Tony mentions, ads on a website are one thing but PayPerPost is totally different. Having contextual ads makes perfect sense and I actually do use them sometimes. When I read a blog it&#8217;s because I actually care about what&#8217;s going on there, I&#8217;m into the topic. So I would be more inclined to look into ads that were about a topic that interests me.

I say go ahead bloggers. Enjoy, you&#8217;ve worked hard.
