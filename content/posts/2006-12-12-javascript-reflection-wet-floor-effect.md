Yes again, I&#8217;m late. I&#8217;m sorry folks, but here we go.

Once again we bring together JavaScript and CSS to produce amazing results. Notice the header at the top of this website (assuming that I haven&#8217;t impulsively changed my theme again)? Nice basic reflection, right? It&#8217;s commonly known as the [Wet Floor][1] effect. I can just hear the Photoshop folks now, &#8220;what&#8217;s so impressive about that?&#8221;. Well seeing that I lack a lot in the Photoshop field it took me about 30 minutes to get this to look even reasonably good. But I did not have to go through all that trouble.

[Reflections.js][2] provides a simple method for web developers to do this. I haven&#8217;t had too much experience with this other than just basic demos but I am again amazed at the power of JavaScript and CSS. You include the JavaScript and for each image you want to add a reflection to you add:

<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate" title="">class="reflect"</pre>

. That&#8217;s it. It almost seems too simple doesn&#8217;t it?
