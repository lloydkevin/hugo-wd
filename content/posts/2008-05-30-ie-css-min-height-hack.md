Now it&#8217;s not surprise to anyone out there that [I hate Internet Explorer][1]. No I mean [I really hate it][2]! One of the reasons that I hate it so much is that it&#8217;s buggy. Call it whatever you want, maybe it&#8217;s too forgiving on bad HTML or CSS, but whatever their intentions are (forgiving sloppy code or just too lazy to interpret code right) it causes tons of problems.

### The Min-Height Problem

I know a lot of you have had this problem in the past. It&#8217;s gotten so bad for me that, at one point, I&#8217;ve just stopped using them. Bottom line, Internet Explorer pretends it doesn&#8217;t see the min-height property. It uses the regular _height_ property as a min-height. Confused? Let me make it a bit simpler:

#### Firefox

The _height_ property is a fixed size. It doesn&#8217;t shrink and it doesn&#8217;t expand with content.

The _min-height_ property is exactly what it says: it gives the element a minimum height, but it still expands with the content of the element. It&#8217;s perfect for if you have an element that will just look totally ugly if you it&#8217;s empty.

#### Internet Explorer

The _height_ property is interpreted as a minimum height, funny enough. Doesn&#8217;t that suck?

### IE CSS Min-Height Hack

But here&#8217;s the good news, there&#8217;s a _fix/hack_. Now mind you, there are tons of different ways to get around this issue. There&#8217;s conditional IE tags, there&#8217;s Javascript hacks, etc. I&#8217;ll focus on two, which I like. So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working with:

<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">#box {
	min-height:100px;
}
</pre>

#### Solution/Hack One

Since, IE doesn&#8217;t understand min-height, we have to force a regular _height_ on the element that the other browsers can&#8217;t see:

<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">#box {
	min-height:100px;
}
/* mac hide \*/
* html #box{height:500px}
/* end hide */
</pre>

To me personally, this **feels right** (because we&#8217;re doing something specifically for IE and hiding it from other browsers), except for one thing: it involves two hacks. As the comments suggest, IE 5 (I think) for MAC does implement the height property correctly. This just gets worse and worse, doesn&#8217;t it?

#### Solution/Hack Two

<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">#box {
	min-height:100px;
	height: 100px;
}

html &gt; body #box {
	height: auto;
}
</pre>

Here&#8217;s the explanation: We set _min-height_ for Firefox (and other well behaved browsers), then we **immediately set the height property so that IE can be happy**. This has the effect of, essentially, defeating the purpose of min-height for the proper browser. We then use the CSS child selectors (which, conveniently IE can&#8217;t see), to set the height back to auto and make everyone happy.

There&#8217;s a slight problem when using 100% heights that [I don&#8217;t really want to get into][3], but you can see a fix for it [here][3].

Why I love this hack, is because it&#8217;s a little bit cleaner. But the **really great part about this** is that, because we only set height to auto as a fix, we can fix multiple elements all in one line:

<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">html &gt; body #box,html &gt; body #box2,html &gt; body #box3,html &gt; body #box4, html &gt; body #etc {
	height: auto;
}
</pre>

Well folks, there we have it. The nasty subject of CSS hacks. Hope this helps.
