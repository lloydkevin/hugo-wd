<!--adsense-->Sometimes we forget that CSS is actually code. Usually it is just thrown together as an after thought because we simply one a few styles here and there. However, anyone who has dealt with CSS files over 100 lines long knows that just throwing together tags in a wild maylay is not the way to go.

CSS code should be laid out and structure just like any other code we write. [Emil at Friendly Bit][1] has a detail article on how to [structure large CSS files][1]. He mentions five (5) main methodologies:

  1. Order your selectors like the HTML
  2. Always use the Ã¢â‚¬Å“full pathÃ¢â‚¬Â to elements
  3. Indent your code cleverly
  4. Each declaration on its own line
  5. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ in alphabetic order
