After reading [this post][1], I have come to the conclusion that Web Developers can learn a lot from this.

I cannot over stress the importance of number seven (7) and eight (8):

>   * Everyone suggests researching webhosting companies, but **for your first year, just use a web host that can get the job done**. I use <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a>, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine except for the 20,000+ visit days &#8230;
> 
>   * If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re serious about your site, **get your own domain name** that somewhat relates to your topic (obviously cleverdude.com doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t relate to finances). Jim recommends <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy.com</a>, but &#8230;

A good domain name is essential to any website. Take your time when picking one. The same goes for a host. I would definitely go with reviews for this. Resist the urge to go with advertising or price solely. I made that mistake and I&#8217;m currently riding out my contract so, hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to move with little problems. Just because a web host is advertised in your favorite magazine doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s the better deal.

If you&#8217;re a blogger, this is a definite read. If you&#8217;re a web designer, scan through the list and extract those that apply.
