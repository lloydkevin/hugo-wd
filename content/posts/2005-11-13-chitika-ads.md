You might have seen ads on this site that deal with stuff like computers, ipods, game consoles, cameras, etc. These are ads by [Chitika][1]. Chitika is the latest company to jump on board the whole website advertisement band wagaon, but the difference is they, unlike a lot of others, do it very well.

Here we go: You choose from various sizes of ads and you give it a list of keywords for which the ads will rotate for. They pay every month to your Paypal account as long as you have accumulated more that $10.00. If not, the payment is defered until you make $10.00.

> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been getting quite a few excited emails from readers who have signed up for the Chitika eMiniMalls that I reviewed last week. There has been a lot of positive feedback so far from those who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve referred over to the program with some people earning some significant money from it so far (including Ã¢â‚¬ËœRachelÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ). There have also been a few (less) emails from bloggers who have failed to see them as effective. 

If you have a website/blog, don&#8217;t miss out on this. Check out [Chitika ads][1].
