## In The Series

  * [Part 1][1]
  * [Part 2][2]
  * [Part 3][3]
  * [Part 4][4]

On the quest for the perfect CMS ([Picking a CMS Part 1][1]), I&#8217;ve decided to switch focus a little bit.

## New Standards

As you guys can see, I&#8217;ve had way too much on my hands to do a thorough job on the quest for the perfect [Content Management System][1]. But then something came to mind. Aren&#8217;t we all busy? No matter how wondering or beautiful a CMS is; it&#8217;s not use if all that beauty is buried so deep that people can&#8217;t find it. If you have to dig more than three (3) pages down on a Google Search page, then it&#8217;s not good enough.

### Popularity &#8211; Just Like In High School

I know, I know, it isn&#8217;t fair, but that&#8217;s how life is. The **popular guys got the girls, they made the football team, and they drive better cars**. That&#8217;s just how life is. If a CMS is popular enough, it&#8217;s going to have certain things going for it.

It&#8217;s going to have **more contributors**. That means more eyes on the code (let&#8217;s hope that this will be a good thing). The more people that know about it means, the **more people that write about it**. Now I will admit, there&#8217;s a little &#8220;chicken vs. egg&#8221; thing going on there. Maybe it gets popular because people write about it. But for our purposes it doesn&#8217;t matter. The fact is, there will be **more formal and informal documentation**.

I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that popular doesn&#8217;t always mean better. Take WordPress for instance. Although _I&#8217;ve never looked_, I&#8217;ve been assured that the **code is quite mangled**. But notice what I said, **I&#8217;ve never looked, and neither will your clients**. No matter how elegant your code is and how fast it runs; none of that matters if your product doesn&#8217;t get out there do serve it&#8217;s purpose. With all it&#8217;s flaws, I&#8217;ve seen WordPress run some of the largest blogs out there, so they must be doing something right. No one returns a BMW because they don&#8217;t like the layout of the engine.

So what does populartiy mean? Sorry to all the new kids on the block. You might be cool, but I just can&#8217;t take that risk.

### Plugins, Modules and Addons.

I don&#8217;t care what you say, no matter how cool a CMS is, it will never everything that you want it to do. That&#8217;s why we need tons of plugins, modules, addons or whatever you want to call them. Let&#8217;s face it, clients always know what they want, until they don&#8217;t and you have to radically change your plans.

Also, plugins are an excellent way for other people to contribute to the community without having to hack the core or something.

## New Playbook &#8211; 20 Minute Dry Run

With all of this said, I have a new plan of attack. I&#8217;m going to right some of these CMSs off the list right off the bat. Again, I&#8217;m sorry to the new comers. It isn&#8217;t fair, but that&#8217;s just the way it is. New platforms run the risk of being underdeveloped and not very well documented or supported. That&#8217;s not a risk I&#8217;m willing to take on a client&#8217;s site.

To get things on one baseline, I&#8217;m actually using a previous site as a common ground for testing. It encompasses some common functionality that I feel all CMSs should be able to handle: Images, Blogs, etc.

## Where Are We So Far?

I&#8217;ve been told that [Frog CMS][5] is an excellent choice of a CMS. However, based on my new rules it&#8217;s not an option. It&#8217;s been in verion 0.9.5 since April 2009. And recently the author (yes, I think there&#8217;s only one) posted a [Still Alive][6] post. So, no offense, but this one&#8217;s not for me.

[ModX][7] seems to have a huge list of [Extras][8] on it&#8217;s page, so it&#8217;s still on my list. I&#8217;m assuming this shows an active community. Let&#8217;s keep our fingers crossed.

## What Have I Tried?

> Those who ignore the past are destined to repeat it.

### Leave The Past In The Past

These words are what keep me away from Joomla. I left Joomla at version 1.5 over three (3) years ago. Although people always swear this is true, the version numbers don&#8217;t show enough significant change from the mess I remember. So, I&#8217;m not touching this thing with a ten foot pole.

### Testing The Drupal Waters

I did bite the bullet and installed [Drupal][9]. I mean, if it&#8217;s good enough for the [President of the United States][10], I should at least give it a try, don&#8217;t you think? There are some things that I like so far:

  * Admin Templates/Themes  &#8211; The backend is extremely flexible. You can change the look, and even the menus that are listed.  With a few modules, you can fine tune the permissions and give clients access to only what you want them to have. So, the argument of &#8220;too complicated for clients&#8221; can be countered.
  * Template Caching &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure how it works, but I love it. Certain things in the template are cached. One of which being the CSS and JS files. You can even combine and minify these. I just love that.
  * Multisites &#8211; You can set up a nice little web farm that all runs on the same Drupal core code. They can even share custom modules. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s something like [WordPress MU][11], but I&#8217;ve never tried this myself.

### Onward and Upward

The quest continues with [Silverstripe][12] and [ModX][7]. Stay tuned.
