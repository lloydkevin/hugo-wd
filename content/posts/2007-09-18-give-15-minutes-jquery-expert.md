### Introduction

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/jquery_logo.gif" title="jQuery - Write Less, Do More" alt="jQuery - Write Less, Do More" align="left" />][1]In the spirit of rapid web development, I&#8217;ve stumbled upon [jQuery][1]. Here&#8217;s a testimonial from a [jQuery][1] user:

> You start with 10 lines of jQuery that would have been 20 lines of tedious DOM JavaScript. By the time you are done it&#8217;s down to two or three lines and it couldn&#8217;t get any shorter unless it read your mind.&#8221;

In my experience it&#8217;s been more like five (5) lines of jQuery.

> jQuery is a fast, concise, JavaScript Library that simplifies how you traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and add Ajax interactions to your web pages. **jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript**.

I&#8217;ve found jQuery great for the following reasons:

  * Simple Ajax in a breeze
  * Search for elements in the DOM is made easy
  * The helper function [ $() ] is a pleasure to use
  * Most importantly: it handles cross browser compatibility.

### Here We Go &#8211; Tutorials Galore

Your first step will be to <span><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/downloads/detail?name=jquery-1.2.1.pack.js">Download</a> jQuery 1.2.1 and include it in the head of your web page. After this you need to start reading some tutorials. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s going to take 15 minutes tops for you to start writing usable code:</span>

  * [Visual jQuery][2] &#8211; This is by far, my number one resource. It consolidates the API in a visual form, making easy to navigate.
  * [15 Minutes of jQuery][3] &#8211; Great for beginners
  * [jQuery for JavaScript programmers][4] &#8211; Interesting tips on how to debug.
  * [Tutorials:How jQuery Works][5] &#8211; Another beginner tutorial
  * [Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery][6] &#8211; Getting Started (for beginners)
  * [Tutorials:Live Examples of jQuery][7] &#8211; This is what worked for me. Sometimes you just have to see it in action.

### Why I Use jQuery

jQuery is fast, small, and easy to learn. It&#8217;s the core for many of the simpler Ajax I use in my web pages. Since I&#8217;m using CakePHP, there&#8217;s also Prototype, but that&#8217;s another story. I really don&#8217;t like having to learn a new language when I&#8217;m trying to do something simple. I don&#8217;t want to go delving into DOM and all that stuff just to dynamically add a class onto an element in the form. If I was a JavaScript programmer, it may not be a big deal for me. But, to me, there&#8217;s nothing worse than writing bad code to get something done, just because you don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s why frameworks are what I live by.

Don&#8217;t wait, get started with jQuery today.
