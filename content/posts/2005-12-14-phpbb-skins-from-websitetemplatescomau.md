Here is an addition to my [previous post][1] on [phpBB skins][1].

WebsiteTemplates.com.au claim to be offering [phpBB skins][2] but I&#8217;ve searched for some on their website and haven&#8217;t been able to find them yet. I&#8217;m wondering what took everyone so long to start offering templates from phpBB. This is another score for Open Source in my book.
