Google has upgraded their beautiful and free Google Analytics for tracking traffic on your website. It&#8217;s all flash and beautiful.

There are a lot of new features that I haven&#8217;t yet investigated, but what I do know, is that it&#8217;s pretty, lol.

Just one thing to note however, I can&#8217;t seem to find the place where they have _average_ visits. You know, the average number of visits per day? In all the adding of new stuff tehy must have overlooked it guess.
