[InstaCalc][1]. Just like the name says, it&#8217;s an instant making use of AJAX. No need to hit &#8220;enter&#8221;. Your results are written as you type, just like any other AJAX application. You can set a number of rows and even set variables and use them similar to Excel. One neat feature is that it understands words like &#8220;thousand&#8221;, &#8220;million&#8221;, etc.

<!--adsense-->You can even define a calculator and then embed it into an HTML page. Give it a try.
