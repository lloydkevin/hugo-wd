Saw this and I was amazed:

[<img src="https://webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/fancy_menu.gif" alt="fancy_menu.gif" title="fancy_menu.gif" border="0" height="59" width="451" />][1]

All done with CSS And JavaScript. The implementation is also brilliantly simple. And it all fits in 1.5KB. What&#8217;s to lose?

By the way, you can&#8217;t tell by the image, but the image under that ![][2]<span style="font-weight: bold">travel</span> menu; it moves with the mouse hover. Check it out: [Facny Menu][1].
