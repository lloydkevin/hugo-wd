<!--adsense-->I&#8217;m not sure how many of you actually gave thought to creating your own Image Gallery, I know I haven&#8217;t. If I needed one I&#8217;d just use a prepackaged one. But that was because my application always needed an entire gallery. But if you just need to through up some pictures a CSS Image Gallery is the way to go.

Why CSS? CSS is light and clean and it&#8217;s HTML standard. Some of these methods require a tad bit of JavaScript.

Please note, however, that you need to have all of your images ready to go. You need your thumbnails, your display images and your large images. These are not scripts, they are Do It Yourself galleries so they don&#8217;t create thumbnails for you or anything like that.

Alex at [YouNeed2See Technology][1] has a nice list of these galleries. Go check it out.
