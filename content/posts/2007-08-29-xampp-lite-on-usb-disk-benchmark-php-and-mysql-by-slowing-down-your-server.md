To develop PHP and MySQL on a Windows machine, I usually use [WAMP][1]. I had tried [XAMPP][2] before, but I found that it was a bit bloated, with the OpenSSL and FTP Server, etc. So WAMP it was. But lately, I decided to give XAMPP another try and I like what I&#8217;ve got so far.

The only life line I&#8217;ve had is my stock of [Portable Apps][4] on my 512MB USB disk. So I&#8217;ve been neglecting a few projects lately. But all of this has changed as of Friday. I&#8217;ve discovered XAMPP Lite. It&#8217;s just what it says it is, a Lite version of XAMPP. The beauty of this is that it can also run from a USB disk. There&#8217;s no install required. So partnered with XAMPP Lite, [Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition][5], [NotePad++ Portable][6], and, [FileZilla Portable][7] I can take my development on the road to anywhere I can stick in my USB disk.

### Added Bonus

I don&#8217;t have to tell you that running an Apache web server, PHP 5.0 and MySQL from a USB disk is not a great idea for a production environment. Disk access to the USB disk is much slower than a hard drive. This has an unexpected benefit that I&#8217;ve noticed with CakePHP. Queries that used to take 3 milliseconds and 4 milliseconds now take 300 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds.

So why am I excited about stuff running so slowly? When you have a table with 20 fields, but only regularly use five (5), CakePHP makes it so easy write _$this->paginate()_ or _$this->findAll();_ to retrieve results that we sometimes forget the all 20 fields are being returned every single time. You see the debug say that &#8220;_3 queries took 10 ms_&#8220;_._ You don&#8217;t really think much of it, but when the debug window says &#8220;_3 queries took 500 ms_&#8220;, you realize that you need to do some work. It makes you think about things that normalizing databases, and caching models, controllers, and views.

### Installing XAMPP

There&#8217;s not really much to it. You [download XAMMP Lite][8], dump it in a folder. That&#8217;s the first part. Now the configuration is where you have to be careful. There are two possible configurations:

  1. Root Directory Installation 
      * Drop the XAMPPlite folder to the root of the USB Disk.
      * Modify your Apache and PHP configuration files as you normally would.
  2. Sub Directory Installation 
      * Drop the XAMPPlite folder in a folder of your choice.
      * Run _setup_xampp.bat_. This will go through every configuration file and set the path based on the drive letter and installation directory. The problem with this installation is that you&#8217;ll have to do this every time you move to a system with a different drive setup (eg. At home my USB is G:, at work it&#8217;s F:)
      * Modify your Apache and PHP configuration files as you normally would.

Everything else you do is as normal. Happy developing. At 130 MB you can&#8217;t go wrong. At 130 MB a pop, you can&#8217;t go wrong.
