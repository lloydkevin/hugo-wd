Ok, by now I&#8217;m guess that we all know what [Writely][1]. It&#8217;s a wonderful little Web (AJAX) based word processor. Does almost everything that [Microsoft Word][2] does and even some things it doesn&#8217;t (PDF creation).

The guys over at [TechCrunch][3] have done an [article on it][3]. There have been many blogs entries on Writely, but this one struck me because of the comments on it. Some people are downplaying what the Writely team has produced here. It really urks me when people sit back and do nothing but criticize what others have done. The idea of a word processor hosted on a server is an exceptional one. People are saying that the Writely project is simple and doesn&#8217;t take more than &#8220;_a couple days_&#8221; to put together. If we look around, we&#8217;ll find that the most of the technology that enters the spot light is that which has been redone in a simpler, more effective way.

This is the challenge I have to all the negative critics, if the project is so simple and easy, why didn&#8217;t you think of it? Why aren&#8217;t you part of the development team?

We need to stop knocking on people with good ideas and simply commend them.

Edit: There are also critics downplaying the PDF creation of Writely. They claim that they only have the standard version of MS Word installed and that simply by clicking _print_ and selecting PDF. Frankly, critics who don&#8217;t even know when they have third party software installed are just not worth listening to. Just my 2 cents.
