How long have you been waiting for this? A step by step tutorial on integrating Google Maps into your web application using Ajax. He starts out with an introduction to the Google Maps API. After this, he delves into more advanced techniques for adding dynamic markers, etc using ajax. Interesting article. By far, the simplest I've seen without making use of some already existing library.

This article is designed to give you a rapid introduction to both Google Maps and Ajax, and to let you get your own interactive maps up and running quickly and easily.
