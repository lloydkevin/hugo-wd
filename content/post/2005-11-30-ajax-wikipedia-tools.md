An interesting article from [ZDNet.com][1] introduces a couple new tools for Wikipedia.

> The popularity of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute, is spawning a host of complementary tools and offshoots.
>
> One of them is called Gollum, a free Web application that creator Harald Hanek describes as a Wikipedia &#8220;browser.&#8221; The tool provides an alternate, streamlined user interface for Wikipedia that puts the search feature front and center and allows for some customization.

The first, [Gollum][2], puts a nice interface on Wikipedia: basically a Wikipedia browser (although it still needs a full fledged browser to run).

The second, [Placeopedia][3], combines Wikipedia articles with Google Maps based on article location. I'm not sure whether there is a huge demand for this, but it is an interesting idea.

Gollum, however, does seem like it's going to have a greater appeal for those who felt the normal Wikipedia interface to be to intimidating.
