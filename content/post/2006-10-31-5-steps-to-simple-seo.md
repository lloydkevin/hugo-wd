I like how they put it, &#8220;SEO isn't rocket science it's more like magic&#8221;. I'm not saying that these steps should replace major SEO from experts. Well, maybe I am. If you're started out from zero SEO I would suggest these tips to you. This way you would understand what SEO and why it is important. That way when you do get into the position (money-wise) where you do need an expert you'll know what you're paying for.
