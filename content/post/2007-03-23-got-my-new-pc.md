Today is one of the happiest days of my life. I finally got my new computer. Here is a quick break down of the specifications:

  * [AMD Athlon 64 X2 3600][1]
  * [256M Radeon X1300PRO GDDR2 PCI Express x16 Video Card][1]
  *  								 								 										[KWORLD PCI Interface TV Tuner Card][1]
  * [1 GB DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Memory][1]
  * [LITE-ON 18X DVD/DVD Burner][1]
  * [Hanns G Black 19? 5ms Widescreen LCD Monitor][1]
  * [250 GB SATA Hard Drive + Plus one of my old 120 GB IDE Hard Drives][1]
  * [Some cheap Creative Labs Speakers (In a noise free apartment complex)][1]

Now I would love to tell you guys to look forward to a lot of new posts, but honestly I'm going to be wrapped up in this for a while. I got a lot of new games to play and a lot of movies to watch on my wide screen monitor :). So, I'll be with you guys in a couple days, lol.

Just kidding. I haven't been able to post lately because I sold my old computer and I didn't want to risk blogging at work. But it's all good now. I'm back.
