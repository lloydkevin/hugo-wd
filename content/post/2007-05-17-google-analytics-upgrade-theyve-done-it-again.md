Google has upgraded their beautiful and free Google Analytics for tracking traffic on your website. It's all flash and beautiful.

There are a lot of new features that I haven't yet investigated, but what I do know, is that it's pretty, lol.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/google_analytic.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/.thumbs/.google_analytic.jpg" alt="google_analytic.jpg" title="google_analytic.jpg" border="0" height="360" width="400" /></a>

Just one thing to note however, I can't seem to find the place where they have _average_ visits. You know, the average number of visits per day? In all the adding of new stuff tehy must have overlooked it guess.
