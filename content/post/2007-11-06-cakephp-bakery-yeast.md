Today I popped onto the [CakePHP Bakery][1] looking for the [obAuth Component][2]. To my surprise, I got a blank page.

Seems like there&#8217;s a database issue. Here&#8217;s hoping that it&#8217;s not down for too long.

_Update (11/20/07):_

Most of the stuff is back up on the bakery. The rating is still a small issue, but all the code and tutorials are up and running.

Bake On!
