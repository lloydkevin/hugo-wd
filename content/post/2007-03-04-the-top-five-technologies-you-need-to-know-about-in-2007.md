#### Ruby on Rails

has been getting real rave reviews lately. Honestly, I haven't delved into it that deeply yet, but from my initial experience I don't see what all the fuss is about, but I promise to investigate more. What I have seen is that a lot of web hosts out there either don't support it or do so at a hefty price to the end consumer. As such, PHP still reins in the world of cheap web developement in my opinion.

#### NAND Drives

These will make more of an impact with notebook computers as they are smaller and lighter than regular hard drives. And being based on flash memory makes these extremely fast. However, as with all new technology, it just costs too damn much right now. 2007 for the rich folks, maybe more like 2008 for mainstream use.

#### Ultra-Wideband

Never heard of it, lol :-), sorry. But you can go [check it out][3].

#### Others

A bit too technical for my liking.
