One problem that I've always had with finding CakePHP related information over the internet is the multiple sources. I wouldn't so much mind if all these sources were legit. The thing that pisses me off is those scrapers who scrape the entire CakePHP mailing list. To me, there's nothing worse than asking a question in the mailing list, then searching on Google for an answer, just to find some idiot has scraped your question from the mailing list. I try to report them when I can, but I just can't seem to keep up.

Sorry for the rant, back to my point. Sharan over on the CakePHP mailing list has made the process of finding the latest CakePHP information a lil' bit easier. Using Yahoo Pipes, he's taken feeds the **most popular CakePHP RSS feeds and consolidated them** into [**one giant feed** - http://feeds.feedburner.com/cakephp][1]. The great thing is that he's also taken some of the non-english blog feeds and slapped on some translation. What more could you want?

I'm not sure how much the author values his privacy, so if you want to get in contact with him and/or view the Yahoo Pipes source for this feed, head over to the CakePHP mailing list and search for: "http://pipes.yahoo.com/sharanbrar/cakephp". If you think that their's a blog missing, just leave a comment here and I'll route it to the author.

Happy Baking!
