One problem that I&#8217;ve always had with finding CakePHP related information over the internet is the multiple sources. I wouldn&#8217;t so much mind if all these sources were legit. The thing that pisses me off is those scrapers who scrape the entire CakePHP mailing list. To me, there&#8217;s nothing worse than asking a question in the mailing list, then searching on Google for an answer, just to find some idiot has scraped your question from the mailing list. I try to report them when I can, but I just can&#8217;t seem to keep up.

Sorry for the rant, back to my point. Sharan over on the CakePHP mailing list has made the process of finding the latest CakePHP information a lil&#8217; bit easier. Using Yahoo Pipes, he&#8217;s taken feeds the **most popular CakePHP RSS feeds and consolidated them** into [**one giant feed** &#8211; http://feeds.feedburner.com/cakephp][1]. The great thing is that he&#8217;s also taken some of the non-english blog feeds and slapped on some translation. What more could you want?

I&#8217;m not sure how much the author values his privacy, so if you want to get in contact with him and/or view the Yahoo Pipes source for this feed, head over to the CakePHP mailing list and search for: &#8220;http://pipes.yahoo.com/sharanbrar/cakephp&#8221;. If you think that their&#8217;s a blog missing, just leave a comment here and I&#8217;ll route it to the author.

Happy Baking!
