We have another member of the Get Paid To Blog family: <a href="http://www.bloggerwave.com" onclick="submitIframeBlogId3392OppId4('1')" target="_blank">Bloggerwave</a>. How does Bloggerwave differ? Well, not by much, but they are still a great service. You sign up and wait 72 hours until your blog is approved. After this, you log on and log for opportunities. Then you just blog your heart away as you usually do.

Posts must stay up for at least 30 days, they have to be relevant, etc. All in all, it's a great service. Give <a href="http://www.bloggerwave.com" onclick="submitIframeBlogId3392OppId4('1')" target="_blank">Bloggerwave</a> a try.
