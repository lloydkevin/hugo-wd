What are you going to be doing on January 15th and 16th? Will you per chance be in the Miami Beach area? Well, there is going to be [Social Networking Conference][1]. This is being held for the Social Networking and Online Personals industry. Speakers include [Yahoo Personals][2], [Cupid][3], [Plenty of Fish][4] and [others][5].

Past conferences have brought together over 300 executives. This would highly benefit anyone who has started or is thinking about starting up an Online Dating or Personals website. I actually know of someone that has recently started [WichitaFallsCupid.com][6]. I doubt he&#8217;ll be making to the conference though, but I will definitely mention it to him. New technology will also be discussed along with methods of increasing traffic and conversions. Attendees who are new to the market also have a great chance to network. And did I mention, they&#8217;ll be minutes from the [beach][7]?

[Registration][8] is about $800 if you get it done before January 10th. That is kind of steep, but if this is your industry you should definitely make an effort to attend.
