For WYSIWYG editing nothing is better than Dreamweaver. A lot of people will disagree but I don&#8217;t care :). Dreamweaver has served me well for a number of years. Every time I had a web project to do, I made sure to set apart a certain amount for development tools. These included Macromedia (haven&#8217;t upgraded since Adobe bought them) Dreamweaver, Flash and a very old version of Photoshop 7.0 that still does tons more than I need.

But what does one do when you&#8217;re away from home and don&#8217;t have your normal tools? Or when you&#8217;re just dead broke? We go open source and freeware, that&#8217;s what we do. For HTML editing, I haven&#8217;t found another free tool that rises to the level that [Nvu][1] has risen to. They haven&#8217;t released a new version since 2005, but it&#8217;s still great at what it does.

For image editing, people swear by GIMP, but I haven&#8217;t really been able to rap my mind around the whole thing. The inner workings still escape me. For editing I use Paint .NET.
