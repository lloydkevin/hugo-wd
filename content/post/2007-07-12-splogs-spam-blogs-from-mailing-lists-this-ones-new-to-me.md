Now, I&#8217;m going to be deliberately vague because I don&#8217;t to give this blogger any traffic.

This is what happened. I developed a new a interest lately. As a result, I was looking for a blog that I could use as a reference. All my searches returned this one blog. The name of the blog was specific to the actual topic. I went on the blog and to my dismay, I saw post after post which looked like emails from a mailing list. The funniest thing is that the Google Groups mailing list from which he was sponging his information was one that I had recently subscribed to. I actually found a pos, which was me asking a question to the group.
  
This is what I assume he did. He went into the Blogger configuration and set up the Blog by Email option. And he used the same email address that he used to sign up to the group. So, every time a message is sent to the group it is forwarded to his email address and ends up on his blog.

Now of course this guy has Google Adsense up on his blog and it trying to rake in some income. Hey, what can I say? I must commend his efforts, but this is just rediculous. What I further don&#8217;t understand is that he has this site up at Blogger, which is owned by Google. It&#8217;s been up for almost two months now, and I don&#8217;t understand why it hasn&#8217;t been canned. It even ranks highly in the Google Searches. Wow. A splog on Blogger (hosted by Google), rips information straight from Google Groups and ranks highly for its topic in Google Search.

I think Google has fallen off their game a lil&#8217; bit. What do you guys think? Where do I go to to report splogs, somebody help me.
