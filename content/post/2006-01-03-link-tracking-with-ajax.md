I found this rather interesting:

> One of the more interesting aspects of Ajax is the ability to track a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interaction within the browser. I wanted to investigate navigation patterns, so I have written an Ajax based link tracker. If you press the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ctrl??? and "X" keys you will be presented with an overlay which displays links usage by percentage. This functionality was created with JavaScript and a very simple API.

Very [inventive use][1] of Ajax.
