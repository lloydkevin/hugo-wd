Dave over at [ILoveJackDaniels.com][1] has a nice cheat sheet in PDF and PNG format. Nice and wallet sized. Included, you'll find a guide to the XMLHttpRequest object, functions and methods (from DOM and otherwise), some simple JavaScript, Regular Expressions and Events.

This has come in very handy to me personally, so I urge any serious web developer (except the experts, of course) to take a look at this and keep it close. Trust me, it is a real time saver.
