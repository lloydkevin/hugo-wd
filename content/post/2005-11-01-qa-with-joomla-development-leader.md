> [LinuxWorld Q&A with Lead Developer of Joomla!, Andrew Eddie][1]
  
> Ã¢â‚¬â€ In September, core developers of Mambo, the popular open source content management system, announced a fork of the project, called Joomla!, with virtually all active participants following the fork.

This is an interesting article. If any of you were wondering about the Mambo-Joomla split, here you go. One thing I forgot to mention is that Mambo is still in existence. I believe it is at the same version where it left off before the split. For me, it seems that Joomla is the way to go. Joomla is being developed by the same development team. And what makes the decision even easier is that most 3rd party developers have started making their Mambots, Modules and Components specific to Joomla.

This is what Andrew Eddie (Development Leader of Joomla) had to say in response to 3rd party products for Joomla:

> I think this is the most powerful area of Mambo and will continue to be for Joomla! Whether you love it or hate it, somehow we have struck on a formula that allows people to easily develop extensions and this is a testament to our growth and popularity. It&#8217;s easy to develop for Joomla! and we want to continue this heritage, if not make it even easier.

In an article at [News.com][2], IBM airs their views about the split:

> It&#8217;s unfortunate for the Mambo open-source publishing software project and for its customers that its developers had to decamp with their source code to start the Joomla project, according to a high-ranking IBM software executive.

Even though I have clearly chosen Joomla in favor of Mambo, does this mean that I am now going to switch all my prior customers from Mambo to Joomla? I think not. For the projects that I am currently still developing, it is only fair to switch. I mean, I am still in the development stage. But to those who have already been spawned and are up and running. They shall remain in the Mambo format. I will, however, speak the praises of Joomla to my client and charge a small restructuring fee if they are interested.
