Faxing is something you don&#8217;t really hear many people talking about these days. Now do you really blame them? With the advent of email, what&#8217;s really the point, right? But there&#8217;s a hybrid: there are high tech businesses that live in a world of fiber optics and T1 lines, but they also need to send and receive faxes. Are they really going to just stick a phone line in there, and slap an old school fax machine on there?

No, they&#8217;re going to hook up a <span><a href="http://www.axacore.com/">Fax Server</a> and use a </span><span><a href="http://www.axacore.com/">Fax Over IP</a> solution for their business. This allows something that allows unlimited users, integrates with Outlook and much more. Yeah at $4,800 a pop for the VOIP version, it&#8217;s a bit steep, but just think of sending several thousand faxes a month over a phone line.</span>

<span>It&#8217;s a brave new world; nice to see </span><span><a href="http://www.axacore.com/">Fax Software</a> stepping into the light.</span>
