Now if you're into Web 2.0 and haven't heard of the [Lightbox][1] script, then you must be living under a rock. If this is your first time crawling out from under that rock, you can get a quick [sample of the Lightbox effect here][2]. Just click on the first picture and watch the magic.

The Lightbox effect is used to pop up a larger image into the forefront of a web page. You start out with a link, usually a thumbnail of the large image. When the user clicks, the large image pops out and the rest of the web page is faded out.

The original Lightbox script uses the Prototype/script.aculo.us combo, so some may complain that it's a bit code heavy. I would tend to agree, since I'm a fan of jQuery however, since CakePHP still uses Prototpye/script.aculo.us for their AJAX functionality, I'm not ready to jump ship just yet.

For those who are, here's a light of the the [Lightbox imitations][3].

There's one called Thickbox, and another version (Slightly thickerbox), which use jQuery, however, it doesn't have the same feel as the original Lightbox script that I've gotten used to.

Merry Christmas and Happy Scripting!
