As you can see from the last post, this blog hasn't been updated in a while. For all intents and purposes, it's a static site.
So why not take this opportunity to test out static site generators?

For this I'm [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). There's been a lot of stuff going around with these, but I haven't had a change to test them out.
A _dead_ blog is the perfect place for this, actually.
