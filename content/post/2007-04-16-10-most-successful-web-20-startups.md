Web 2.0 has been really spreading like wildfire the past few years, but there area few sites that have really taken total advantage of it and used it to the fullest. Here&#8217;s the big list of 10:

  1. [MySpace][1]
  2. [YouTube][2]
  3. [FaceBook][3]
  4. [Wikipedia][4]
  5. [Bebo][5]
  6. [Digg][6]
  7. [Flickr][7]
  8. [Netvibes][8]
  9. [Del.icio.us][9]
 10. [Meebo][10]

The first 4 aren&#8217;t a big surprise. These are the big contenders in the game right now. I thought Digg and Flickr would have a higher ranking though. What does surprise me is Meebo in at number 10. It&#8217;s great to see a new start up gaining ground so fast.
