In February of 2006, we should expect the release of a new [Joomla Book][1] entitled [Building Websites with Joomla!][2]. I&#8217;m curious to see how much they pack into this one.

There is another book by the same author, [Building Websites With Mambo : A fast paced introductory tutorial][3], which left much to be desired for me. If you&#8217;re looking for a quick, light, step by step procedure manual then I guess this will be enough for you. But if you&#8217;re looking for anything other than how to navigate through some of the menus you need to look somewhere else. This basically packages a small among for Mambo&#8217;s online documentation and sticks it in a paper back. But it is interesting to see anything about this CMS being published.
