OK, I know I said beginner. Actually, they said beginner, but this article goes very much in depth into SEO. I've beein applying different SEO techniques to my websites, websites I've done in the past, and just SEO for certain clients. I've been doing this for a bout two years now and even I learned some things from this article.

[SEOmoz | Beginner's][1]: They go into the following topics. Trust me, it's long but it's a great read.

  1. What is SEO?
  2. How Search Engines Operate
  3. How to Conduct Keyword Research
  4. Critical Components of Optimizing a Site
  5. Building a Traffic-Worthy Site
  6. Growing a Site's Popularity
  7. Conclusion: Crafting an SEO Strategy
