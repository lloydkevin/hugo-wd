For those of you just wiping the remnants of 2006 out of your eyes welcome to 2007. If it's January 1st and it's before daylight I hope you're just reading this before you go to bed or something, because if you aren't out with friends partying, I truly feel your pain. lol.

To the rest of you stumbling upon this post at a reasonable hour I have a great way to start out 2007 with some AJAX. [The Register &#8211; RegDeveloper.co.uk][1] has a nice step by step tutorial on [Developing Web Applications with AJAX &#8211; Part 1][2]. The topics include:

  1. Overview of XMLHttpRequest
  2. Installing Software
  3. Configuring JBoss with MySQL Database
  4. Creating an Eclipse Project

They use JBoss here as a Java backend. You can try this to begin with however as soon as you understand the tutorial, it should be clear how we can replace the Java backend with something normal like ASP or PHP. Or if you really like Java then go right ahead.

Enjoy the tutorial and once again: Welcome to 2007. Jah Guidance.
