OK, now this is really cool. If you ask me it's a beautiful use of AJAX.

  1. Pick a category
  2. Search
  3. Click on an item and get a pop up with details
  4. Click and Drag items to the shopping cart on the right

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/uncluttr.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/.thumbs/.uncluttr.png" alt="uncluttr.png" title="uncluttr.png" border="0" height="156" width="400" /></a>

Yep, that's it. The name fits great. There is absolutely none of the clutter that you get from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon's</a> main website.

This site deserves a lot more than what it's getting right now.
