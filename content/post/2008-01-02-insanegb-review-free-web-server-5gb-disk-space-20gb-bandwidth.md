I can't remember where exactly I heard about this web host, but [InsaneGB.com][1] sounded like a great deal. You can read [their website][2] for more details, but in a nutshell they got PHP 5, MySQL 4, and everything (Databases, Add-on domains, etc) is unlimited except disk space and bandwidth. They give you **5GB for disk space and 20GB on bandwidth per month**. Which is great for a free host, if you ask me; heck, they even offer [cron jobs][3].

### Testing Their Setup

So I decided to give them a shot. I put up my personal blog on their server. In retrospect, maybe that wasn't such a great idea, but I did it anyway. At first everything was great. Stuff was fast and everything was popping up instantly. There were some things that most would consider acceptable for a free host.

  * #### I couldn't run any PHP ini_set commands

    So there's no increasing running time for scripts. I guess I would live without that.</li>

      * #### You can't open/download any files from outside servers

        This I came across when trying to use some of my WordPress plugins that automatically install plugins and automatically upgrade the WordPress installation. Oh, well.</li> </ul>

        For a savings of at least $7 a month, I guess I can install scripts and upgrade WordPress myself.

        ### Where They Lost Me

        So with every free host, there's some give and take. But I just experienced some **major downtime**: upwards of two (2) hours.

        Oh well, sounded like a good idea at first.
