The "[Real-World AJAX One-Day Seminar][1]" is scheduled for Monday, March 13th 2006 in New York City. There are some huge names that are going to be speaking at this seminar:

> This one-day AJAX seminar will feature 15 speakers in 11 sessions, including the world's most renowned AJAX experts: Jesse James Garrett, the Father of AJAX; David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails (with his very first talk on "AJAX in Rails"); Satish Dharmaraj, the creator of server-side Java; Bill Scott, AJAX evangelist of Yahoo!; Scott Dietzen, the creator of WebLogic; Rob Gonda, the bestselling AJAX author and evangelist; and Ross Dargahi, well-known AJAX evangelist and architect.

There are also going to be speakers from companies that have real world use of Ajax. Keep an eye out at [www.ajaxseminar.com][1] for registration information. If it wasn't for school and the fact that I'm almost a thousand miles away, I would definitely be there.

Right now, in my opinion, Ajax is being used all over the place haphazardly. I honestly do hope that this seminar answers a lot of questions for all and possibly the development of some sort of Ajax standard could be started.
