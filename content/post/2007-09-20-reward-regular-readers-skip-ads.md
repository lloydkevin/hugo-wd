Now I know you&#8217;ve read about this and it&#8217;s usually a good idea: concentrate most of your ads on your older posts and hide ads from your regular visitors. I mean, they come here everyday, reward them with a little bit of clean content.

But also, if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re lazy and haven&#8217;t gotten around to coding this yet. Well here you go, a WordPress plugin that I&#8217;ve stumbled upon: [Who See&#8217;s Ads?][1].

First of all, you can display anything in these blocks: HTML, JavaScript, even PHP. The ad blocks are controlled by certain contexts. It&#8217;s a lil&#8217; bit like coding if you think about it. You still a bunch of _if statements_ together to determine whether or not your content is displayed. These include:

  * Regular visitors &#8211; Which you can define by those who&#8217;ve viewed your content a certain number of times within a certain period (eg. twice in 10 days).
  * Coming from search engine &#8211; Self explanatory I hope.
  * Posts older than a defined number of days
  * Logged in visitors
  * Between a particular date period
  * If the ad was viewed a certain number of times &#8211; You could set and expiration duration
  * And even custom PHP conditions &#8211; Here you can stick in WordPress functions such as _in_category()_;

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/who-sees-ads.png" title="Who Sees Ads" alt="Who Sees Ads" class="imageframe imgalignleft" align="left" height="172" width="556" />][1]You can insert these contexts into your template with PHP calls or into your posts, with comments.

With Who Sees Ads? you can completely revamp your ad structure. I&#8217;ve even begun to experiment with it on here. There&#8217;s just one slight problem with WP-Cache, but you can&#8217;t have caching with dynamic content, can you?
