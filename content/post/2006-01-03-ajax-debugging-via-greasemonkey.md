Honestly I don&#8217;t see why this hasn&#8217;t made more of an impact because this script is awesome. One of the pains that Ajax developers go through is [debugging][1]. Now, with the help of [Greasemonkey][2] the XMLHttpRequest object can be traced.

The [Greasemonkey script][3] was written by a guy named Julien from [Curiosity is bliss][4]. Trust me, [XmlHttpRequestDebugging][3] is one script that is going to save a lot of time with Ajax development.

Please make sure you get the [updated version][5] though.
