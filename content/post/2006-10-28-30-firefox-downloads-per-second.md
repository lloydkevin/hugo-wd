> Apparently, people loves them some Firefox. Within 24 hours of the official launch on Tuesday, there were over 2 million people using Firefox 2, and we were seeing a peak rate of more than 30 downloads per second from our website.

With Firefox being my favorite browser, I can see what all the buzz is about. If this pace keeps up they'll beat the stats of [IE7 with about 3 million in 48 hours][2]. I guess they have it right, make a good browser and people will download. Just for histories sack let me remind you guys of how the stats have been in the past.

  * Firefox 1.0 &#8211; 1 million downloads in 24 hours.
  * Firefox 1.5 &#8211; 1.5 million downloads in 24 hours.
  * Firefox 2.0 &#8211; 2 million downloads in 24 hours.

Do I sense a trend here? Regardless Firefox has gotten out to a strong start.

One thing to note, however, when comparing these stats to that of IE7 is that Firefox is multi platform and there is no Windows Genuine Advantage to hinder those running not-too-legal copies of Windows XP.
