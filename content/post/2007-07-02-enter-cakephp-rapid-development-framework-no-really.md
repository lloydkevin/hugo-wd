Almost two months ago I mentioned that I was looking into some [PHP Frameworks][1] I must say, that I've procrastinated with the whole thing. Since then I've caught up on a few. A friend of mine tried introducing me to <a href="http://codeigniter.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/codeigniter.com');">Code Igniter</a> framework. I didn't really get a good feel for it. He mentioned that it was more powerful and flexible, but I'm lazy, so I was looking for a lazy man PHP Framework.

#### Enter [CakePHP][2]

Here's a bit of background. I know you've heard of Ruby on Rails (RoR). I mean who hasn't? Well, I'm one of those guys who never paid it much mind, and for that I was wrong :). RoR introduces the [MVC][3] model: [Model-View-Controller][3] pattern. What these Frameworks do is bring this pattern to the PHP platform and I love them for it.

CakePHP is a bit simpler than <a href="http://codeigniter.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/codeigniter.com');">Code Igniter</a> at first, so that's what drew me to it. However, this weekend I stumbled upon the [Baking][4] capability of CakePHP and I was hooked. I have an upcoming project, which I've decided to use CakePHP on. I will keep you posted on how things go.

This is what helped me make my decision: [CodeIgniter vs. CakePHP][5]

Good Luck to you guys.
