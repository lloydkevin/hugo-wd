[New AJAX Website Unveiled: AJAX.sys-con.com @ SYS-CON AUSTRALIA][1]

> If you want to learn AJAX you should probably buy a few books, buy an AJAX IDE, and go to a few training classes. But all three things will cost you money. So why not first mingle with people that already know it, by visiting &#8211; at no cost &#8211; the very latest and fastest-growing AJAX web site, http://ajax.sys-con.com &#8211; it's where the prime movers of AJAX come to learn who's doing what in AJAX, why, when, and with whom.

I just stumbled upon this. You may want to take a look. I'm still browsing around. More to come later.
