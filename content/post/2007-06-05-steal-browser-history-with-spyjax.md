Ever wanted to find out what your users have been up to before they came to your site? Yep, you now have that power. I can see that little twinkle in your eyes now. You&#8217;re thinking that this is just insane and you can only imagine the power that now lies at your fingertips. Well, it&#8217;s not that easy.

#### How It Works

First of all, stop freaking out. We&#8217;re not exactly stealing your browser&#8217;s history. We&#8217;re doing a bit of guessing. It can only be run against a defined list of sites. This means that you can only check whether someone has visited a site, say [Disney.com][1], but you can&#8217;t ask their browser for a list of the sites they&#8217;ve visited. That information is still kept confidential by the browser.

What we do is use some JavaScript to check the color of the links on a page. Ahhh, I see the lil&#8217; light bulb going on over your head right now. Yep folks, that&#8217;s all. Nothing fancy. So rest at ease, your browser history is safe for the most part.

[SpyJax][2]: Go check it out, and figure out how to stop it, or at least limit the way people use it on you.
