Ever wanted to find out what your users have been up to before they came to your site? Yep, you now have that power. I can see that little twinkle in your eyes now. You're thinking that this is just insane and you can only imagine the power that now lies at your fingertips. Well, it's not that easy.

#### How It Works

First of all, stop freaking out. We're not exactly stealing your browser's history. We're doing a bit of guessing. It can only be run against a defined list of sites. This means that you can only check whether someone has visited a site, say [Disney.com][1], but you can't ask their browser for a list of the sites they've visited. That information is still kept confidential by the browser.

What we do is use some JavaScript to check the color of the links on a page. Ahhh, I see the lil' light bulb going on over your head right now. Yep folks, that's all. Nothing fancy. So rest at ease, your browser history is safe for the most part.

[SpyJax][2]: Go check it out, and figure out how to stop it, or at least limit the way people use it on you.
