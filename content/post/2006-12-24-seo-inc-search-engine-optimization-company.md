#### Introduction

[SEO Inc][1] offers, guess what, Search Engine Optimization for your website. Their services include:

  * [Natural Search Engine Optimization][2]
  * [PPC Advertising Management][3]
  * [Web Analytics][4]
  * [SEO Copywriting][5]
  * [Optimized Press Releases][6]

They also have interesting products like an [SEO Toolbar][7], which analyzes SEO of a given website and an [Engine Tracker][8], which tracks the progress of website over time. The toolbar is free and is pretty cool. It gives nice basic information in a convenient toolbar in your browser.

#### Credentials

They seem to have an impressive [client list][9], including the Marriot Hotel and Microsoft. Not bad.

#### Judge a Book By Its Cover

Now you know I need to touch on the design of this site. First off, it's pretty. It's real pretty. Nice layout, some basic Flash in the upper right, nice and simple. A simple fixed-width design with a shadow. Just one problem though (you know I always find one), to me (and a lot of other designers) good SEO = Tableless Designs. So I don't know exactly how much you should penalize these guys for the ugly mess of tables they have on their website. I feel that if you offer a service to webmasters your website should be a prime example of that service. After doing a Google Search for [seo &#8220;search engine optimization&#8221;][10] I got tired when I didn't find them after 300 sites. Is this a reflection of their service, who knows. I mean after all Microsoft did use them.

#### Last Thoughts

I say request a quote and see what they have to offer. The services do sound impressive. Let's hope the results match these.
