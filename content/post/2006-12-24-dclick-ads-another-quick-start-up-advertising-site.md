#### Introduction

[Dclick Ads][1] is another program, similar to [Text Link Ads][2], where advertisers can buy links on different websites and publishers can sell space on their websites. Right now, since they've just launched, there are a number of very small and new websites that you can buy links on, but as time progresses, I'm sure this will pick up.

#### First Impressions

What can I say? It's another link share program. Their main features include:

  * Buy and Sell all Ad Types of advertising classic banner ads, standard text link ads or premium embedded links directly within the text content of web pages.
  * DirectLink Technology for advertisers. Ads placed on publisher websites are directly linked to your website for maxium traffic and click thru performance.
  * SmartCache Ad Serving Technology for publishers utilizing xml ad serving distribution. Maximum uptime and lowest system resources. No system downtime or delayed page loads.

[Dclick Ads][1] offers both Pay-Per-Click and Pay Per Impression system. Checks are mailed out every month and their appears to be no set minimum earning for mailing out checks.

#### Design

This is my only issue about this website. The design leaves a lot to be desired. The first problem is that on the [main page][1] has a fixed width of 738 pixels. Now that's just great, however the main content section has a width of 782 pixels, which creates a huge bloated look to the website. They should have really checked this out before they launched, because it gives the site a very unfinished look.

The other problem is the icon/logo and possibly the entire design of the website. As a web designer I would observe this more than the average user, but the icon used comes from a Template Monster template. They could at least have changed the default icon/logo used. This leads me to believe that they simply used a template fresh out of the box. Now templates are all good, however from a web designer's standpoint, one would be sort of cautious about a website that slaps up a template without changing the default icons and checking to see if their content fits the template.

#### Conclusion

What can you really say? It's a fresh site. The only thing you can do is give them a try and see how it works out for you and urge them to work on their design a lil' bit.
