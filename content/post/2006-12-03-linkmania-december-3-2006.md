  * [HeliPad: The Flexible Web Notepad][1] &#8211; Not sure about this one. I've used it and I must say it's pretty, but I still rather the feel of [Writely][2]. It's a person thing though.
  * [CSS Bubble Tooltips][3] &#8211; Why pull out all that JavaScript for a simple tool tip. Nice and clean.
  * Learn HTML and CSS with another [Sam's Teach Yourself Book][4].
  * Sometimes you need an email address for just about 5, maybe [10 minutes][5].
  * Developing in Linux, [Part 1][6] and [Part 2][7].
  * [Snap Preview Anywhere Install Tutorial][8] &#8211; Interesting lil' tool. Gives a web page preview of the site when you hover over the link.
