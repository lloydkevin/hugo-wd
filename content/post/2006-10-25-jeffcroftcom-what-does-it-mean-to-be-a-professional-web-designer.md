[Jeff Croft][1] Writes:

> But there was a mindset created in the 90s that anyone could make a web page. That line of thinking led bosses to direct secretaries and copy editors to produce corporate sites and a whole wave of self-proclaimed &#8220;designers&#8221; to start selling their services as web professionals.

That is so true. And like Jeff, I was one of them. Fired up my copy of Frontpage or Adobe Go Live and I was good to go. He also states that &#8220;many people never made that leap from hobbyist to professional&#8221;, which is so true.

> I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely awesome that my 11-year old daughter could make a personal website if she wants to. Where I have a problem is when these people start to _sell_ their services or get senior-level jobs in the industry.

I must say this is a bit of an over exaggeration. I don&#8217;t think that a lot of the &#8220;professionals&#8221; who sell their services can be grouped into this category of &#8220;hack&#8221; as he puts it. I feel that if someone is searching for a web design professional a simple look at that person&#8217;s/company&#8217;s portfolio should give a clear indication of what their skill level is.

> they buy a copy of Photoshop or Dreamweaver and call themselves a web designer. This is a little baffling to me. No one thinks if they have a hammer theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the skills to be a professional carpenter. No one decides they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need a doctor if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a stethoscope of their own.

This is a a bit funny, I must say. But again I believe that it&#8217;s only true to a certain extent. I say if some &#8220;hack&#8221; can get Dreamweaver and Photoshop and slap together a good looking Web page that is functional then let them. I say if they do a good job let&#8217;s call them &#8220;professional&#8221;.

> [Mark Boulton recently wrote][2] about the idea of a professional body for the web design industry in which memberships would be based on peer review, creating a sort of Ã¢â‚¬Å“unionÃ¢â‚¬Â of serious, quality web designers.

This might a good idea, but as Jeff states, that may never happen since clients usually don&#8217;t have a time or experience to properly evaluate Web designers. I know that this happens for a fact. I, a &#8220;hack&#8221; myself, have gotten projects where some clients don&#8217;t understand &#8220;what&#8217;s taking so long&#8221; after the initial design. They don&#8217;t understand XHTML standards; they don&#8217;t understand that saving 4 seconds of load time by using CSS over tables is a good thing; they don&#8217;t understand why I need to optimize the MySQL calls. And the thing to remember is that most of them don&#8217;t care. As a Web designer you have to consider what the buyer wants. I usually try my best to steer them away from a &#8220;slap together&#8221; job but they don&#8217;t understand and further more they don&#8217;t understand why they are paying me for SEO, etc. So sometimes as a Web designer you have to simply cut certain costs based on what a client wants, understands, and is willing to pay for.

I don&#8217;t yet have the financial stability, like Jeff, where I can tell a client &#8220;if you&#8217;re not willing to pay for proper CSS design, Table-less design pages then got to a &#8216;hack'&#8221;. I&#8217;ll take whatever job I get and do the work that amounts to the amount of money being paid.

I have run into this problem when using open source 3rd party scripts. No one is willing to put up the money required for a custom shopping cart, therefore I slap on Zen Cart and make everybody happy.
