<!--adsense-->Personally, beyond a simple Flash banner, I don&#8217;t see much use for it in the web development world. Yes, it does have that coolness factor if you do it right. But the fact is that too many people do it wrong right now. My number one reason for not using flash is that it kills SEO. Well let&#8217;s say that&#8217;s my number two reason, number one: I can&#8217;t really use it :).
