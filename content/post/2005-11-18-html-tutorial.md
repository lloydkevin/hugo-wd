Since this blog does (claim to) encompass all sorts of Web Development. I've decided to insert a couple basic links. I'm not much for HTML my self. Honestly speaking, I don't know much HTML and I refuse to learn it. Yes, I am a Web Developer and have designed 20+ websites in the past 4 years, but HTML is something I'm not too good at. If you ask me, it's all in the tools you use.

Since my personal knowledge is limited in this field I've provided you with a series of links to site which have helped me:

  * [W3Schools][1]
  * [Davesite][2]
  * [HTMLGoodies][3]
  * [Webmonkey][4] (My personal favorite)

I do hope these help you on your HTML quest, if you choose to embark on one.
