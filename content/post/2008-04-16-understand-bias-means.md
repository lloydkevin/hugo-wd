Somehow I don&#8217;t think most people understood what my [bias comparison of CakePHP vs Ruby on rails][1] meant. The last few visitors to comments seem to have been Rails fans. One of them seems to think that I shouldn&#8217;t touch Ruby on Rails with a ten foot pole and should stick with CakePHP. He doesn&#8217;t want someone like me in _their community_. The other comment, I get the opposite vibe from. He strikes me as a PHP fan, who thinks I&#8217;m too lazy for the PHP community.

To all the folks that haven&#8217;t seem to understand my whole objective, let me help you guys out. I have general interests in a lot of areas and I also work a 9 to 5 job. So I don&#8217;t really have the time and dedication required to poor my heart and sole into everything that comes along. I do a brief overview of something before I spend tons of time delving into it. People are pissed that I&#8217;m comparing CakePHP to Ruby on Rails and haven&#8217;t even tried it yet. This is where the brief overview comes in; I took a quick look and realized that for what I was doing at the time, Ruby on Rails would have been more trouble that it was worth.

Furthermore, the title of the post said &#8220;Bais Look&#8221;. I state all the reasons, why I pick CakePHP. The first one is that I&#8217;m lazy. Again, whatever I do is for a purpose. Other than general interests, I just don&#8217;t have time to sit and pour over every framework. Where does it end? CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, etc? I&#8217;m not an overactive hobbyist. I take a quick look at things that spark my general interests, then figure out how to make the best of use of them. But I&#8217;m aware that a lot of people have different opinions and people are passionate about their opinions. So, you guys are excused :).
  
With that said, I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint either the CakePHP or Ruby on Rails community (depending on how you look at it, lol). I&#8217;ve started a project lately, for which I think I required the stability, establishment, and huge resource of plugins, etc that Ruby on Rails has to offer. Also, they got a a few books and it never hurts to broaden your horizons. At least when I mention Ruby on Rails to a potential employer, they&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about. But regardless of what you like, what you&#8217;re passionate about, or why you use what you use; remember this: [No One Cares][2]. It&#8217;s all about what you do with it.
