Now I don't have to tell you guys about all the [goodies that WordPress 2.5 brings][1], but I'll name a few anyways:

  * New fresh Admin theme
  * Nice Dashboard
  * You can modify the link for "Incoming Links". Technorati anyone?
  * Finally included Tag Management
  * Concurrent Post Editing Protection
  * One Click Plugin upgrades. Oh yes. It's about time.
  * Built in Gallery
  * Nice Flash Media Uploader

There's just ONE thing that rubs me the wrong way.

They've gone an given the admin theme a fixed width layout, designed for a 1024px monitor. Why, WordPress, why? This is really a pain, after I decided to get (not one, but) two 19" Wide Screen LCD monitors. Luckily, there's a [plugin][2] that puts things back into perspective.
