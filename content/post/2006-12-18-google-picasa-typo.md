I know that a lot of you have heard about [Picasa][1]. It is a brilliant image manager from Google. It manages all the images on your hard drive, imports everything from your digital camera and all that other cool stuff. They&#8217;ve recently added an option called [Web Albums][2]. Here you can upload pictures and create a, um, well Web Album. Now from the program you can upload the images.

I&#8217;m sorry to Google, but I just thought this was so hilarious. It&#8217;s just a lil&#8217; problem with Grammar. &#8220;This web album is contains 121 items&#8221;. My girlfriend always finds these so amusing. She did have a jolly laugh on this one when I showed it to her.
