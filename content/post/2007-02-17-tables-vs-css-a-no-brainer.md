#### Introduction

Here we go again, the age old story. Do we use plain old HTML Tables or do we invest the time and energy into learning and using CSS properly? Duh, it's not even worth saying anymore. Tables suck, tables have always sucked. The only thing that keeps tables going for so long is their ease of design.

#### More Evidence

[Tables Bad, CSS Good][1] tells us, again, why we should us CSS whenever possible:

>   * Search Engines: I have redesigned many websites eliminating tables and placing all links in unordered lists and have seen there search engine rankings improve drastically.
>   * Compatibility: Remember that in todays day and age websites are being viewed on everything from 60 inch plasma TVs to 3 inch cell phone screens. If you assign a table a width of 780 it becomes near impossible for visitor using a handheld device to view your website.
>   * Accessibility: People with disabilities have the right to enjoy the web! If your website uses tables a visitor using an audio browser is going to have trouble accessing your website. Go ahead and try to use your website with and audio browser

Still having doubts; I really don't know what to tell you right now. Just get over yourself and grab hold of CSS with both hands and promise never to let go ever again.
