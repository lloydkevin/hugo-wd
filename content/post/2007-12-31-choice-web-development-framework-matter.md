After reading about [Matt's Experience with the Zend Framework][1], I came to the conclusion that one's choice of a Web Development Framework doesn't really matter. **There are tons of frameworks out there** and there's a good reason for that. People still use them. If no one used a framework it would die a quick and painless death. Different frameworks offer different benefits to different people.

However, I'm willing to bet that **_First Choice_ is one of the main factors affecting a developer's choice of framework**. I fell into CakePHP first because I had an initial choice of CakePHP and Code Igniter. I couldn't quite get CI working quickly enough, so I jumped on CakePHP and I've been here ever since.

Something else which solidifies the _First Choice_ method is that the frameworks are sufficiently different that there is a learning curve when moving from one to the other. If you've started using one framework effectively, learning another (even to discover potential benefits) is usually not worth the time.

So I say this to you; be confident in your choice of a web development framework. [Code Igniter][2], CakePHP, [Symphony][3], even [Ruby on Rails][4], it doesn't matter and **no one cares as long as you can crank out functional web applications** in a reasonable amount of time.
