## What

I&#8217;ve never been

Used starter themes before, never child themes.

Genesis much like starter theme&#8230;html already laid out, CSS also (if wanted).

Uses hooks in actions and filters

## Why

Honestly: bought theme from StudioPress in the past. no longer available, gave me genesis and a child theme. Was interested

reasons remind me of why wordpress (link to past). Large community, always updated, etc.

## How

Slapped it on and started playing.

Visual hook guide thing.

Searching through core code for how. Explain my process.

Development slicker and more modular (instead of patching huge theme files)

More focus in functions.php
