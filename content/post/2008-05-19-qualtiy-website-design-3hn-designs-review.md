So, you've been reading this blog for a while and you're (hopefully) picking up very valuable tips on website and web application design. But just like all other do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, no amount of tips or tutorials in isolation is going to make you an expert. So you throw your hands up in say "I'm done with this web design crap!" But, you still need a website. So what do you do?

[Shameless Plug]

### Enter 3HN Designs.com

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.3hndesigns.com">3HN Designs</a> comprises of a group of, you guessed it, three (3) developers that have a common goal: to provide quality designs at an affordable price.

Services Provided include:

  * Website Design
  * Web Application Development
  * Logos
  * Search Engine Optimization
  * etc.

They offer static web design, along with a custom CMS approach and other forum, gallery, and shopping cart scripts.

### Under The Hood

So what does the finished product comprise of? Well it <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.3hndesigns.com/pricing.htm">depends on what you pay for</a>. At the base price of $500.00, you'll come away with a nice, fresh looking XHTML/CSS web site that you can mangle to your hearts content.

If you choose to shell out a lil' bit more, you get something a little more flexible, in that it's dynamic and you can edit a change the content at your leisure. Now this is my favorite part: it's written in CakePHP. Nothing flashy, just a editable regions using FCKEditor or TinyMCE. There are also some nice generic options that can be changed, such as: site name, contact email address (for the contact form), etc.

So, if you're in over your head on a project or you just don't have the time to deal with a website right now, head over to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.3hndesigns.com/">3HN Designs for Quality Website Design</a>

P.S. I say _they_ because it's a little bit less shameless then _we_ ðŸ™‚
