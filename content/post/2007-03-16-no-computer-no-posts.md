I know a lot of you might be wondering what's going on, but once again we're gonna have to take a short break. I recently sold off my old computer so right now I'm paying for internet access and I don't have a computer. OK, I'm not a total idiot. I did make a purchase recently. I ordered a bunch of computer parts, since I'm building the new one. Here's the problem. Like an idiot, I forgot to get a heat sink and a fan for my CPU. So I'm waiting for these to arrive in the mail. It should be some time next week though. But this is where I am.Ã‚ The only other place I have internet access is of course at work, but seeing as I just started this job, I'm not trying to get yelled at so soon. So I guess it's see you guys next week.
