I know a lot of you might be wondering what&#8217;s going on, but once again we&#8217;re gonna have to take a short break. I recently sold off my old computer so right now I&#8217;m paying for internet access and I don&#8217;t have a computer. OK, I&#8217;m not a total idiot. I did make a purchase recently. I ordered a bunch of computer parts, since I&#8217;m building the new one. Here&#8217;s the problem. Like an idiot, I forgot to get a heat sink and a fan for my CPU. So I&#8217;m waiting for these to arrive in the mail. It should be some time next week though. But this is where I am.Ã‚ The only other place I have internet access is of course at work, but seeing as I just started this job, I&#8217;m not trying to get yelled at so soon. So I guess it&#8217;s see you guys next week.
