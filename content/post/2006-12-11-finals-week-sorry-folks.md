OK, so things have been a little bit hectic so I haven't gotten around to posting for a while. Here is a basic run down of what has been going on so far (much more detail to come later):

  * Finals start today. Yes, this struggling college student is about to go into finals week and obviously I'm going a bit crazy.
  * We've had end of semester project dues. One project, Software Engineering, was proving to be a major pain. Not the project itself, but the process by which it was to be delivered. Let's just say, this whole &#8220;group work&#8221; thing isn't all it's cracked up to be.
  * I'll also be graduating. Yep, it's finally over. In one week I'll be putting on that gown and walking through those doors. Wait a minute, where's my gown. Whoops, mental note: &#8220;Need to check on gown at the bookstore&#8221;. We've been having graduation practice and all this good stuff.

So basically, I'm about ready to pull my hair out from the roots. But I'm trying my best to hold on to what little sanity I have left. Things should be back in full swing on Thursday.
