OK, so things have been a little bit hectic so I haven&#8217;t gotten around to posting for a while. Here is a basic run down of what has been going on so far (much more detail to come later):

  * Finals start today. Yes, this struggling college student is about to go into finals week and obviously I&#8217;m going a bit crazy.
  * We&#8217;ve had end of semester project dues. One project, Software Engineering, was proving to be a major pain. Not the project itself, but the process by which it was to be delivered. Let&#8217;s just say, this whole &#8220;group work&#8221; thing isn&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be.
  * I&#8217;ll also be graduating. Yep, it&#8217;s finally over. In one week I&#8217;ll be putting on that gown and walking through those doors. Wait a minute, where&#8217;s my gown. Whoops, mental note: &#8220;Need to check on gown at the bookstore&#8221;. We&#8217;ve been having graduation practice and all this good stuff.

So basically, I&#8217;m about ready to pull my hair out from the roots. But I&#8217;m trying my best to hold on to what little sanity I have left. Things should be back in full swing on Thursday.
