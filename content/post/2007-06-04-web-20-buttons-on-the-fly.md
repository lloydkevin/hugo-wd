Now I&#8217;ve never really been a Photoshop guy. I just don&#8217;t have an eye for that stuff, even if it may be very basic. What&#8217;s my solution? [My Cool Button][1]. This service allows you to created, not to bad if I do say so myself, Web 2.0 buttons on the fly.

A lil&#8217; PHP and GD2 sure does go a long way these days.
