For most of my real quick image editing I usually use [Paint.NET][1]. That&#8217;s for when Photoshop is overkill and I&#8217;m not really a Gimp man, sorry. And of course MS Paint, or whatever it&#8217;s called now, it&#8217;s going to cut it, ever. But what do you do when you&#8217;re not home and away from your normal tools? Well I just use Paint.NET on my flash disk, but that&#8217;s another story.

Here is what normal people do: [Snipshot][2]. Here are some of the greatest features:

  * Import from any website or upload your own pictures
  * No need to download anything. Runs totally in a browser
  * Save files as GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG, or TIF
  * Crop, rotate, resize
  * Contrast, brightness, saturation, sharpness and hue
  * Files up to 10 MB

One feature which deserves a little more explanation is the [Bookmarklet][3] they provide. Save this bookmark to your browser&#8217;s favorites and anytime you&#8217;re browsing on a website and see a picture you&#8217;d like to edit, click the [Bookmarklet][3]. It brings up the [Snipshot][2] website with a list of all images on the page. Just click one and edit away.

Nice utility to have in a pinch if you need to do some quick touch ups.
