They are basically targeting any websites that serve links, which are not _natural_. This generally includes any links that have been sold on the website.

[PayPerPost][1] is one of the largest companies out there that pay bloggers to post about different things. They are generally instructed to keep their reviews relevant to their content, but sometimes bloggers stray a bit. Of course Google has made these blogs a prime target for the Page Rank drop.

The irony is that PayPerPost uses (used) the Google Page Rank as a way to quality a blog. Now that damn near all PayPerPost blogs are hit by Page Rank drop (with a lot of them dropping out right to 0). They're going to implement their own method of blog ranking:

> >   * 70% &#8211; visitors per day
> >
> >   * 20% &#8211; amount of ACTIVE inbound links per day (outgoing clicks)
> >
> >   * 10% &#8211; pageviews per day
