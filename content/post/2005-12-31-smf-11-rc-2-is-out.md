I just made a [comment][1] in a previous post about [phpBB vs. SMF][2] where a user mentioned the pains that we all go through when upgrading phpBB. I [commneted][1] that I cannot actually compare upgrade procedures between the two packages because from the first install of SMF a new version hasn&#8217;t come out.

And here comes the irony: [SMF 1.1 RC 2][3] is out today.

After scanning through the [upgrade][4] procedures, it doesn&#8217;t look like anywhere near the horrors of upgrading phpBB. They say that there _may_ be some issues with previous themes, which they gave a [fix][5] for. I haven&#8217;t tried the upgrade yet, but from all reports it only invloves uploading some files, changing some permissions and then running a step by step script. The only file editing I see is to [fix old themes][5].

Here goes another notch in the belt for SMF. Right now, phpBB is quickly fading for me.
