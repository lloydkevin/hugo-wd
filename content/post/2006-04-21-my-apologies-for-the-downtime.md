Well, it&#8217;s not really downtime, but I apologize none the less. It just hasn&#8217;t been the same since I got back from vacation. I&#8217;ve had virtually no time to myself to make any productive posts. There have been issues with school, with computer access, internet access, etc. As a result I decided instead of posting sporadically, I&#8217;ll simply wait until I can dedicate the amount of time that needed to this blog. That time is rapidly approaching though. In a month&#8217;s time, the posting will be back up to what you are used to.

A lot has happened in the world of Ajax since then. Not so much code-wise, but a lot of developers have sprung up out of nowhere with tons of Ajax applications showing off their skills. Some are good and some simply suck, but that&#8217;s the world of Ajax, where everybody who&#8217;s anybody is trying to get into the loop.

Once again, let me apologize to the few dedicated readers that I once had. I only hope that I haven&#8217;t scared our relationship for good and that I may entice you guys to put my feed back into your RSS reader.

See you guys in May.
