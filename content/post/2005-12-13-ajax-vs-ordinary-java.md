excerpt: "This article caught my eye and I'm including it simply for your perusal, but I disagree with him.  For people who have been developing Java Applets for the past um-teen years, then this argument holds a lot of ground, however for people like myself Ajax is the perfect answer.  The application that I am working on is primarily developed in C.  The whole web application portion of the program is an add-on and soon needs to be automatically generated by the C application.  Ajax opens the perfect door for this type of functionality."

> I can agree that big Internet guys [Google] can and should invest some serious dough into supporting screen-refresh-on-mouse-move in HTML-based screens. But when it comes to a regular Intranet business application, when the users/browsers/platforms are known and when the cost of the project development matters, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d stay with a fat client written in Java, or (if you like a fancy GUI) Macromedia&#8217;s Flash or Flex. 

This article caught my eye and I&#8217;m including it simply for your perusal, but I disagree with him. For people who have been developing Java Applets for the past um-teen years, then this argument holds a lot of ground, however for people like myself Ajax is the perfect answer. The application that I am working on is primarily developed in C. The whole web application portion of the program is an add-on and soon needs to be automatically generated by the C application. Ajax opens the perfect door for this type of functionality.

I&#8217;m curious to hear what you all think. Java or Ajax?
