Now I've seen everything, holiday Ajax jingles:

> [All I want for Christmas is Ajax

> I don't want a tall skinny tree

> or lots of presents under it.

> All I ask for are some Web 2.0 goodies

> that are zipped and not wrapped.

> I want PHP and not PAJAMAS.

> Give me widgets and not gadgets.

> Give me a torrent of flashy de.licio.us gifts that flickr brightly under MySQL clouds.

> ....][1]
