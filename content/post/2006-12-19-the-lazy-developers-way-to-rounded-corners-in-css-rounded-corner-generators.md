Are you one of those guys who just loves the look of Rounded Corners, but doesn't like the footwork required? It's your lucky day, sort of.

Rounder corners are developed using, rounded corner images of course, CSS style to set those images as backgrounds, and the content of the box surrounded by a number of divs. You need one div for the content of the box. Then you need two divs above that, for the top corners and two below it, for the bottom corners. Should be simple enough right?

Well if it's not, here are a couple of Rounded Corner generators that you can use to slap together the code really fast. The even generate the images for you if you don't have your own.
