Asaf Sabag, a Hebrew webmaster finds [success with Joomla][1].

> Joomla! roadmap is what convinced me to stick with Joomla!, the next version of Joomla!, due to release very soon will have an improved RTL support and more important 100% UTF-8 compatible, and as you know these are great news for us Hebrew, right to left users.

I just love hearing these stories of people who have been struggling with other nukes and CMS's and finally found Joomla/Mambo.
