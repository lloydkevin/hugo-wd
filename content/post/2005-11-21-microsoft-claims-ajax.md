Brian Goldfarb, a Microsoft Product Manager, had an [interview][1] some days ago where he answered questions about the company's plans with Ajax development tools. This is quite an interesting article. However, I love the way that Dion at Ajaxian.com [summarized things][2] summarizes things:

> To some up:
>
>   * &#8220;Ajax is hard&#8221;
>   * &#8220;Microsoft invented Ajax&#8221;
>   * &#8220;Microsoft will make it easier&#8221;

This was basically what Brian Goldfarb seemed to have been getting to.
