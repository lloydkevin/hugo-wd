Now I know we've all had this problem. Starting up a new website and waiting for the visitors to come rolling in. With blogs it's one thing. There are many services for blogs that do pings every time you submit an article and stuff like that. [Technorati][1] is a great one of these services. There are also blogrolls, blog searches, etc.

But what about normal websites? What if you have a business website and need some promotion? What are you supposed to do? Enter [DiscountClick][2].

First of all there is their [Internet Marketing Starter Service][3]

> Perfect for websites and business just getting started and need guidance and assistance in online search engine marketing. With this service we will analyze which keywords would best fit for your website. We then get your ads appearing on google, yahoo and msn, as sponsored listings which appear on the top and right hand side of the search results

For a one time charge of $500.00 you get listed in the sponsored link section of Yahoo, Google and MSN. But that's not all. Before this you get a website analysis. Basic SEO, a keyword analysis, a sponsored listing and a set up for basic bidding.

Now some of you may be yelping at the $500.00, however consider this. To launch an even remotely effective ad campaign on just Google, using Google Adwords, is going to cost at least $10.00 a day. I was trying to set up one and they didn't recommend I go below that amount. For one month, that runs you up to $300 for the month. And that is with you picking your own keywords and no SEO at all. Basic SEO and/or keyword analysis will run you at least $300. Bottom line, [DiscountClick][2] offers these services in a bundle.

Their cheaper services include [Self Service SEO Tracking & Tools][4] for $100 monthly. This includes reports on search engine referrals, costs per visitors, multiple websites under one account, keyword density tool analysis, etc. This includes 100,000 page views. Any thing higher costs a 10th of a cent per page view.

Bottom line, great service and package at a great price. Check them out: [DiscountClick][5].
