Now we all should know how to upload file using ordinary forms right? This was great back in the day, but we've been pushing Web 2.0 for some time now and it only seems fitting that we find another way. Now there was <a href="https://webdevelopment2.com/swfupload-beta-upload-using-flash/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to SWFUpload beta: Upload Using Flash">SWFUpload</a>, which is a beautiful Flash utility that gives us this functionality, but it does use Flash, which a lot of web developers tend to steer away from. Flash is usually left up to the designers among usâ€š It does degrade nicely to the regular form if no Flash is detected.

We now have an HTML version for those of us who just hate Flash and all what it stands for :). Ideally we would like to have an AJAX version of this like we have in Gmail, but no dice. Not yet anyways. Here's our best substitute: [micoxUpload][1].
