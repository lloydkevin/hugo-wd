I'm not sure what to make of this: [Automated JavaScript Vertical Flip Image Reflection][1]. It adds reflections to images using JavaScript. But, am I missing something here, or has it [already been done][2]? It seems to do basically the same thing with less flexibility and it doesn't work in IE.

The only other difference that I can notice is that this is works on a page-wide basis, whereas the other script is on a per-image basis. Here are some [examples][3].
