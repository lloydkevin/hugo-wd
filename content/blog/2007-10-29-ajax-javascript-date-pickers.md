One thing which I usually find quite annoying is using input boxes in forms for user entered dates. Having the user manually enter date, day, month, year seems so 1997 to me. However in the interest of time, this is what most programmers slap into the web applications simply because it's easier to produce and easier to maintain.

Well here's a handful of solutions that can solve that problem for you. Create user friendly and attractive date entries with these [Date Pickers][1]. Some are just normal entries used for basic forms, while others have more database integration.

Some use the jQuery library. Others use mootools or the Yahoo! UI. No matter what your needs, you'll find something here that you can use.
