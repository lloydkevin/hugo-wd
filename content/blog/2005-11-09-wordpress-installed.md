I finally took it upon myself to install WordPress. I mean I'm just been hearing so much about the darn thing, I figure, why not give it a shot. I've been using Mambo (now renamed to Joomla) for a while. It's a complete website CMS. I've been using it on a couple sites and realized sooner or later that most of my site simply boiled down to just a blog anyway. So I decided to give the actually blogging software a try.

It does seem rather light. I guess that's not so much of a bad thing. There are a log of plugins for it though. Not a vast library like Joomla and very little tool integration, such as forums (phpBB, SMF, etc); but I guess that's just not what it's meant for. It's for blogging and it seems to do this well so far.

I do like the fact that the templates are highly CSS based and the Google Sitemap plugin is incredible. It does URL rewrite stock (out of the box) where as for Joomla, you need to jump through a few hoops to get this done right.

All in all, after about 30 minutes of playing around with it, I doesn't seem too bad. I'll continue playing with it though and try to keep this blog up.

BTW, this will soon be moved to either http://www.klloyd.net or https://www.kevinlloyd.net/

_Edit:_

One quick note though, the spell checker I installed doesn't seem to be working.

_Edit:_

Ok, got it working. It was a server problem.

_Edit:_

As you may notice, I've purchased the domain name. This is a fresh WordPress install so please excuse the default template. I'm brand new to WordPress, so theme design is gonna take a while. ðŸ™‚
