<a target="_blank" href="http://testape.com/webtty_sample.php">WebTTY</a> is an interesting package. During my internship I actually had to do something like this. My employer didn't appreciate a pre-packaged solution though, so I had to produce all the code myself.[

][1]

> The WebTTY package allows any Linux terminal processes to be controlled in a text area HTML element on a webpage. The output from the server process is collected on server side, and is send to a text area element. Keypresses in textarea are collected on client side and send to the server process. WebTTY uses AJAX/DHTML patterns to achieve in-page updates without refreshing the entire page.
