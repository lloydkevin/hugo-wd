First off, let me apologize again for the lack of posts, [again][1]. Would you believe it? My internet connection was down for an entire week. I almost dug out my eyeballs. And it came up the day before I leave for the second part of my vacation.

The good news is that, this leg should only last a couple days. So I should be back up and posting by Tuesday. I get back on Sunday, but I'm going to need a few days to catch up on stuff. The way technology advances these days, missing a week seems like a year sometimes.

See you guys on Thursday.
