This may be one of the most difficult things to consider when starting up with AJAX. There are a lot of [AJAX Tutorials][1] out there that give you good background information. And it's good to know what's going on behind the scenes, it really is, but let's face it if you're going create anything worthwhile with AJAX, it makes no scene to do it from scratch. As a developer, I'm a big fan of frameworks. If you think it about it enough, everything is a framework for something. I suppose that if you have a couple hours (days depending on your skill level) you could write a very functional console application that emulates a basic calculator in sssembly code. Or, you could fire notepad, write a quick C++ application in about 5 minutes and compile and you're fine.

In the same respect, you could use C++ and create a very graphical Windows application or you could use C# and the .NET Framework and fire one out in minutes. Why should web development be any different? Frameworks are there for a reason. A team usually develops a Framework over a long period. They get all the kinks out and they make it available for you guys to use. If a bug is found, they do a fix and put out a new version. You simply replace the files that you use.

AJAX is the same way, with one exception, there are just [too damn many frameworks][2] out there and that makes choosing very difficult. This should make things a little bit easier: [How to choose an Ajax Framework ?][3]
