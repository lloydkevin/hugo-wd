One thing that I liked about the jQuery website is that they offer a compressed version of the jQuery script on the website ready for immediate download and usage. This is convenient if you don't want to go through the few steps it takes to Minify your own javascript code.

Well we now have this same luxury for [Prototype and its Script.aculo.us library read for download][1].

Enjoy folks.
