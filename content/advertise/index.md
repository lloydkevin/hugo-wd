Now it wouldn't be fair to charge you without having a look at what you're paying for now would it?

I get upwards of 9,000 visitors a month, with about 250 RSS visitors.[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/analytics.gif" alt="Traffic Statistics - Google Analytics" title="Traffic Statistics - Google Analytics" width="615" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-428" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/analytics.gif 615w, /wp-content/uploads/analytics-300x149.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" />][1]

### Ad Solutions

We provide ads on a monthly basis on this blog. We offer three ad solutions here at Web Development 2.0:

  * [125 x 125 button links][2] - These are by far the best performers. Your ad will be one of the four (4) ads in the right sidebar.
  * [Static Text Link][3] - You'll get a text link under the 125px button links.
  * [Inline Link][3] - These are links placed inside of a post. These links will be of already existing text in the post.
  * Feed Footer Link - Your ad will one of ten (10) rotating ads at the bottom of the posts in the RSS feeds.
