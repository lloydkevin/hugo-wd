### Statistics &#8211; Traffic, RSS, etc

Now it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to charge you without having a look at what you&#8217;re paying for now would it?
  
I get upwards of 9,000 visitors a month, with about 250 RSS visitors.[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/analytics.gif?resize=615%2C306&#038;ssl=1" alt="Traffic Statistics - Google Analytics" title="Traffic Statistics - Google Analytics" width="615" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-428" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/analytics.gif?w=615&ssl=1 615w, https://i2.wp.com/webdevelopment2.com/wp-content/uploads/analytics.gif?resize=300%2C149&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

### Ad Solutions

We provide ads on a monthly basis on this blog. We offer three ad solutions here at Web Development 2.0:

  * [Inline Link][3] &#8211; These are links placed inside of a post. These links will be of already existing text in the post.
  * Feed Footer Link &#8211; Your ad will one of ten (10) rotating ads at the bottom of the posts in the RSS feeds.
